Isabeau of Bavaria became the queen of King Charles VI of France in 1385. She was born 
into the House of Wittelsbach, the eldest daughter of Duke Stephen III of Bavaria-Ingolstadt and Taddea
 Visconti of Milan. Isabeau was sent to France at age 15 or 16, where the young French king liked her
 enough to marry her three days after they met.
